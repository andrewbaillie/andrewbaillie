## üë®‚Äçüíª Experience

**Senior Software Engineer** @ [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/) (September 2021 - Present)<br/>
**Software Engineer** @ [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/) (August 2019 - August 2021)<br/>
**Junior Software Engineer** @ [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/) (August 2018 - July 2019)<br/>
Joined the BBC in 2018 as an opportunity to improve myself and try new tech that I wasn't getting exposure to working in web development.

- Built an analytics pipeline for the ingestion of data from a new [Voice product](https://voicebot.ai/2020/06/02/bbc-voice-assistant-beeb-launches-in-beta-in-the-uk/) that was being built in the same department.
- Later expanded that pipeline to support ingestion from multiple sources including [Alexa devices](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0957KX2C4) and Rest APIs.
- Working with the [BBC's Synthetic Voice](https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/worldnews/2020/life-project) created a pilot for the playback of Portuguese language Brazilian news articles.
- Using the same synthetic voice produced a pipeline generating 12,000 weather forecasts every day, these where used in both the [Interactive News Alexa Skill](https://voicebot.ai/2019/10/23/bbc-launches-interactive-news-service-for-alexa/) and the [BBC's Weather app](https://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/articles/c7219x55vygo).

<br/>
**Developer** @ [Everyone](http://www.weareeveryone.com/) (March 2012 - August 2018)<br/>
Working full time as a web developer building complex bespoke websites using the in-house CMS.

- Built a web interface for a ticket booking system that a client was using offline, allowing the public to book tickets to single events and build an itinerary for a more complex multi event ticket.
- Multiple e-commerce websites requiring integration with payment processors (typically Sage), booking systems or intranet hosted CRM systems.

<br/>
**Developer** @ Techno Data Solutions (December 2006 - March 2012)<br/>
Working full time primarily as a web developer building bespoke CMS backed websites from scratch, some design work in Photoshop depending on
the needs of the company.
